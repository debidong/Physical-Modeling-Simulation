# Physical-modeling-simulation

The program is used for the problem in CUPT of 2022 ( China Undergraduate Physics Tournament ).  
Designed to simulate the throwing of a cylindrical three-sided dice.

## ver 1.0
Using overly ideal assumptions to simulate, which makes only the radius and the height of the dice may infect the result.  

## ver 2.0
The simulation of the bounce is added, which makes the simulation much more realistic.  
Physical parameters are set by default, but also can be changed.
